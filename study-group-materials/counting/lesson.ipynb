There is rarely true universal notation. While many symbols in mathematics and logic have some level of consensus surrounding their purpose, as is the case with code, there are many ways of describing or solving a problem. For this reason, it is common to see the same concept described multiple ways. If you see an equation you do not recognize, it could be because you are unfamiliar with the concept, but it could also be because whoever wrote the notation is using symbols differently than you would expect. Either way, you can make sense of the equation! It just might take a little effort.\n",
